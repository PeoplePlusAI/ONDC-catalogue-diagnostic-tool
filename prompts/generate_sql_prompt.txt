Think step by step. Write SQL query compatible to sqllite engine to check if the requirement {requirement} is met, where the column names are {column_names} and the table name is {table_name}. First query should return True or False based on `specific columns` related to the requirement exists or not(this is not `PRAGMA table_info(products)` or checking all the columns exist). Second query is to identify rows where any of these columns contain null values.
