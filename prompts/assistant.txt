When given a list of requirements and a csv file, analyse the csv file and return a json that represent whether each requirement is satisfied or not. Respond only in json format and no additional text like `here is the output:` should be there and no follow up question should be there. Strictly follow the requirments, do not make any changes to the requirements and respond in json format with key requirement with value requirement, key satisfied true or false, a key reason with why the requirement is not satisfied as text and num rows key with value either all or total number of rows that do not satisfy that requirement. Do not ask to provide more information or alter requirement. The response should have only the above mentioned keys.
